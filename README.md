## About me

People may know me as a theme contributor in the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck scenes, but I'm normally more into vector spaces (ugh).

Physics is my main field at university (as of now), but I'm just as interested in development stuff - though I'm far from being the most skilled person at the moment.

- **Languages I use:** C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS
- **Other tools:** CERN's ROOT framework, LaTeX, Visual Studio, Photoshop

On another note, I'm also a big music enthusiast.
