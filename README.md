## About me

People may know me as a theme contributor in the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck scenes, but I'm normally more into vector spaces (ugh).

Physics is my main field at university (as of now), but I'm just as interested in development stuff - though I'm far from being the most knowledgeable person at the moment.

On an unrelated note, I'm also a huge music enthusiast.

- **Languages I'm likely to use:** C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Other tools:** CERN's ROOT framework, LaTeX, Visual Studio, Photoshop
- If you enjoy my work and feel like showing support, you can [buy me a coffee there](https://ko-fi.com/kalyvara). Greatly appreciated!
