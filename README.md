Physics university student in my third and final year of undergraduate degree at university.
Active contributor for the Nintendo Switch themeing scene since October 2022. Feel free to check out my creations at [my Themezer profile!](https://themezer.net/creators/382997176307154945)
While I'm still fairly new to the scene, I'm thinking about developing actual homebrews for Nintendo Switch some day.

**Languages I'm familiar with:** C++, Python, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, SQL, outdated PHP4 (haven't done web development in a while)
**Frameworks/software I use:** Windows 10/11, Linux (Ubuntu/Manjaro) ; Anaconda, ROOT (C++ based framework developed by CERN mainly used for particle physics simulations)

**Most notable projects I've worked on:** code simulations for specific cross sections in nuclear physics, adiabatic process in thermodynamics, GPS using generated pseudo-data

I don't know what I'll actually submit on this profile. But hey, at least I have a GitHub profile now.
